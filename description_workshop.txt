Block's Combo Meters introduces combo mechanics common to various action games into the world of Terraria. With this mod, you can enjoy 2 client-sided combo systems, complete with vanilla-faithful UI and tons of config settings;

[h2]Letter Rank meter:[/h2] 
Deal damage with sufficient DPS to build your combo and gain letter-based ranks!
[list]
    [*]Rankings range from F to S (Or higher via. config!)
    [*]Your combo gradually drains over time, demanding increasing DPS levels to continue ranking
    [*]Ranking will scale as you progress since it's DPS based
    [*]Taking damage will substanially deplete your combo
    [*]Includes Rank Meter UI that displays your progress towards each rank
[/list]

[h2]Hit Counter meter:[/h2]
Counts up each hit you land, but resets if you fail to inflict damage for too long. Simple as that.
[list]
    [*]Introducing the 'Combo-Clock': UI that sits behind your hit count and spins to indicate how much time is left in your combo
    [*]By default, your combo ends after ~3 seconds without landing a hit
    [*]Your combo will idmediatley end if you take damage
    [*]When a combo ends, text will appear above your player to show the final hit count.
[/list]
