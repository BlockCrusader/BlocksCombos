Block's Combo Meters introduces combo mechanics common to various action games into the world of Terraria. With this mod, you can enjoy 2 client-sided combo systems, complete with vanilla-faithful UI and tons of config settings;

Letter Rank meter: 
Deal damage with sufficient DPS to build your combo and gain letter-based ranks!
- Rankings range from F to S (Or higher via. config!)
- Your combo gradually drains over time, demanding increasing DPS levels to continue ranking
- Ranking will scale as you progress since it's DPS based
- Taking damage will substanially deplete your combo
- Includes Rank Meter UI that displays your progress towards each rank

Hit Counter meter: 
Counts up each hit you land, but resets if you fail to inflict damage for too long. Simple as that.
- Introducing the 'Combo-Clock': UI that sits behind your hit count and spins to indicate how much time is left in your combo
- By default, your combo ends after ~3 seconds without landing a hit
- Your combo will idmediatley end if you take damage
- When a combo ends, text will appear above your player to show the final hit count.

Customization: As mentioned before, Block's Combo Meters has ALOT of config, including;
- Meter choice: Toggle between the Letter Rank and Hit Counter meters, or use both at once! Meters track performance even when hidden
- UI positioning: Move the meters around, they default to the left of the minimap
- Display your way: Both meter type has many different visual styles to pick from!
- Penalties(?): Adjusted or remove combo penalties related to taking damage
- Feedback: Both meters come with sound and visual feedback, which can be toggled and customized
- And More: The majority of the aspects of both meters can be customized in some way!

Final notes/disclaimers: 
- Combos have no affect on gameplay in terms of combat, only visual effects and audio feedback
- Shoutout to the 'Terrarian's Style Rank' mod, by BlixerCZ, which inspired me to make a combo mod of my own. If you like DMC5 and/or want something more intricate or flashy, definitley check it out!
- And of course, have fun and happy combo-ing!
